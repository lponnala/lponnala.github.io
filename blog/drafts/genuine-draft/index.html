                <p><strong>RODBC Error</strong></p>
<p>Reading a 32-bit MS Access database (*.mdb file) using RODBC could lead to this error, if you're using 64-bit R:</p>
<p>The simple workaround to this is to make RStudio point to the 32-bit R on your machine (which gets installed along with the 64-bit default):</p>
<p>This seems to be a simpler fix than trying other options listed here and here.</p>
<p><strong>Learning guitar the hard way</strong></p>
<p>If you're a happy keyboard player, making a transition to the guitar isn't really a piece of cake. I have been trying to learn acoustic fingerstyle guitar lately, motivated by a few Pandora stations. I discovered a few websites that provide plenty of good information, one in particular is noteworthy, and easy to remember - http://www.acousticfingerstyle.com/. In my new-found enthusiasm, I hurriedly purchased two volumes of Scott Tennant's "Pumping Nylon" series, which I am told, has a cult status among guitarists.</p>
<p>I was happy to be able to follow (and read the music for) some of the early exercises, but the going got tough pretty soon. Tabs are good and easy to grasp, but cannot capture many of the subtleties involved in playing the piece. Notation, on the other hand, is way too hard for the beginner. I admit I've had some exposure to sight reading in the past, but that was many many years ago, and I never really got the hang of it back then! The pieces on the CD sound awesome, but it's taking me a long time to read the music and get the fingering right.</p>
<p><strong>Software for learning sight reading</strong></p>
<p>Some things work best if you build them yourself. Sight reading software might just be one of them. I've been searching online for (preferably free) software that can push me along the path to sight-reading and simultaneously playing a piece of music on the guitar. I mean the real sheet music, not tab!</p>
<p>There are a few that charge anywhere from $30 to $50, but I don't feel they're worth that much. There's 3 software packages that I've installed on my laptop - guitartrainer, tabplayer and desktopguitarist. They're all free but each one has its demerits - guitartrainer doesn't work on Windows Vista (some arcane MIDI format problem that Microsoft casually forgot to address :)), tabplayer is ofcourse for tab only, and desktopguitarist's free version is limited only to the first 5 frets. I like guitartrainer the most, because it gives you good drilling exercises, and can also operate in "show me" mode.</p>
<p>In my mind, an "ideal" software should be able to take a piece of sheet music and show you which strings/frets need to be played on the fretboard while the piece is played. Is that too much to ask (or do)? Well, let's see.</p>
<p>First, you would need an interface that is able to read music from the input sheet and convert it to a series of interpretable notes, including timing information. Then, a lookup table can be used to extract the note positions along the fretboard, which can then be shown on a graphical display in "serial" fashion. I'm guessing this is doable in MATLAB, with the extensive suite of GUI tools available. The hardest part might be the first step, i.e. interpreting the input sheet music notation.</p>
<p><strong>When is the Kalman Filter optimal?</strong></p>
<p>There are several versions that say roughly the same thing, while some of the delicately dance around the central issue and leave it to references! Sometimes, authors don't even state the conditions right. So, here's an attempt to bring everything into one blog, and possibly point out mistakes in what people have said. I believe it's best to work through the derivation.</p>
<p>Along the lines of [Simon Haykin, Adaptive Filter Theory, 4th Ed], here goes:</p>
<p><strong>What is Kullback Leibler divergence?</strong></p>
<p>I've seen it a few times ever since I started reading about change detection algorithms. The first time I saw it was in Basseville's book on abrupt change detection, then in Gustafsson's definitive treatise "Adaptive Filtering and Change Detection", and now of late I saw a paper that came out in 2004 or so that used the information-theoretic measure for finding genes! (but I bet they used only the character sequence) Ha! What an interesting idea to explore the addition of free energy to it, or, simply use estimated free energies alone to detect changes in reading frame using this K-L divergence. But first, what exactly is it?</p>
<p>In loose terms, it measures the "distance" between two distributions. Wikipedia has a nice article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback-Leibler_divergence</p>
